# Data Cleaning in SQL

### <ins>Dataset:</ins> <br> 

In this project, we'll be introducing the 'Nashville Housing Data' dataset containing data on the home value for the Nashville housing market. The objective here is to explore various data-cleaning techniques using Microsoft SQL Server. The dataset is open-source and was sourced from Kaggle. 

There are more than 56000 rows in this dataset and 19 columns titled: UniqueID, ParcelID, LandUse, PropertyAddress, SaleDate, SalePrice, LegalReference, SoldAsVacant, OwnerName, OwnerAddress, Acreage, TaxDistrict, LandValue, BuildingValue, TotalValue, YearBuilt, Bedrooms, FullBath, HalfBath. There are a lot of inconsistencies in this dataset which make it perfect for practicing data cleaning.

### <ins>Objectives:</ins> <br> 

In addressing these inconsistancies, we'll be performing the series of tasks listed below: <br> 

1. Standardizing the date format wherever necessary. <br> 
2. Populate the NULL values that are present in the PropertyAddress column. <br> 
3. Break out the Address, City, and State into individual columns wherever necessary. <br>
4. Converting abbreviations into their respective full forms wherever necessary. <br>
5. Removing and deleting duplicate values. Deleting unused columns. <br>
